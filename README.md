# 3D Surface Segmentation using Spherical SOM

This project implements an unsupervised 3D surface segmentation method based on **Spherical Self-Organizing Maps (S-SOM)**. It clusters face normals and geometric information from a 3D mesh using a spherical topology, then refines the segmentation through post-processing steps.

## Features

- Load a 3D mesh (.obj) and compute face normals
- Apply Spherical SOM to segment the surface based on normals
- Post-process to:
  - Separate disconnected regions
  - Merge small regions
  - Merge similar regions based on surface orientation
- Visualize segmentation results using `pyvista` 

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `numpy`
- `pyvista`
- `matplotlib`

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run Facet segmentation using normal vector as feature descriptor
python .\main.py --obj_file='./Models/brick_part01.obj'

## Run Part segmentation using precomputed SDF (in a *.sdf file with same name and in same folder with *.obj) and curvature
python .\main2D.py --obj_file='./Models/9.obj'
